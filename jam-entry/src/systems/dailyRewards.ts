// Daily reward track for RUN games: a finite, ordered list of rewards,
// claimed one per local day, with miss-day forgiveness.
//
// Copied in from @series-inc/run-game-helpers (systems/daily-rewards/), same
// posture as src/systems/ads.ts — never imported from that package at
// runtime. Depends on src/shared/serverTime.ts, already present in this
// project (systems/ads.ts's own daily cap uses it too — one trusted clock).
//
// Design: missing a day NEVER resets progress. The
// next claim is always the next unclaimed slot in the track, no matter how
// many calendar days passed since the last claim — the only gate is "one
// claim per local day". Friendly by construction: there is no streak to
// lose, so there is no punishment mechanic to explain or apologise for.
// When every slot is claimed the track is finished forever.
//
// State is two fields persisted inside the host's save blob:
//   { claimed: int, lastClaimDay: 'YYYY-MM-DD'|null }
// This module reaches that object only through the injected getState()
// accessor — it does NOT import the save system. It also does not persist,
// toast, or recompute anything: claimNext() mutates state and applies the
// one-shot grant, then the CALLER runs its pipeline (persist, refresh UI,
// toast, schedule the reminder).
//
// Time authority: serverNow() (trusted server clock, extrapolated locally)
// answers "what time is it"; localDayKey() (device-local midnight) defines
// the day boundary. Re-sample with refreshServerTime() on boot, on resume,
// and every time the popup opens — not just at boot.
//
// Typing: createDailyRewards is generic over the game's reward-def type.
// Define the def shape once and applyReward/claimNext/forEachClaimed are
// typed:
//
//   interface MyReward extends RewardDef { type: string; amount: number; }
//   const dailyRewards = createDailyRewards<MyReward>({ ... });
