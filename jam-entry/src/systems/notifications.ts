// Local-notification reminders for RUN games: permission bootstrap, a
// declarative reminder catalogue, cancel-first dedupe by custom id, and the
// sliding "come back" re-engagement pattern.
//
// Copied in from @series-inc/run-game-helpers (systems/notifications/), same
// posture as src/systems/ads.ts — never imported from that package at
// runtime.
//
// Model:
//   - Reminders are DATA. config.reminders maps a custom id to
//     {title, body, delaySeconds}; arm(id) schedules one. The custom id is
//     what dedupes on the platform side — every schedule cancels the same id
//     first, so re-arming never stacks notifications.
//   - The re-engagement reminder SLIDES. rescheduleReEngagement() is called
//     at every "player is active" moment (boot, resume, end of run), so the
//     pending reminder always sits N hours past the LAST activity and only
//     lands once the player actually stops playing.
//   - Schedule while the app is ALIVE — never from onSleep/onQuit handlers.
//     A hard close tears down the JS runtime before the schedule RPC reaches
//     the host, so anything armed at close time silently never registers
//     (backgrounding works, hard-kill doesn't).
//   - Two independent gates. config.isOptedIn is the game's own settings
//     toggle: it suppresses scheduling, and the settings UI calls
//     cancelAll() on opt-out. The platform permission (ensureEnabled) is
//     bootstrapped once at boot — but schedule() deliberately does NOT check
//     the cached result: it always attempts and lets the host no-op if
//     notifications are off, so one failed/stale boot-time probe can't
//     silently block a whole session's reminders.
//   - Every SDK call is try/catch'd: in mock mode (local dev, no host)
//     everything no-ops safely, and nothing ever leaks an unhandled
//     rejection out of a lifecycle-adjacent call site.
